# Memory Game Planning


1. Game Board: The game board is where all the cards are laid out in a grid. 

2. Cards: Each card on the game board represents an item, image, or symbol. There are two identical cards for each item, creating pairs. Players need to find matching pairs by flipping cards.

3. Card Faces: A card typically has two faces: one with the item's representation (e.g., an image, number, or icon) and one with a uniform design.

4. Card Flipping: Players interact with the game by clicking on cards to flip them. When a card is flipped, it reveals the item's representation.

5. Game Logic: The game logic is responsible for managing the game state and actions. It includes functions for:
	> Flipping cards.
        > Checking if two flipped cards match.
        > Keeping track of the number of matched pairs.
        > Determining when the game is won.
        > Implementing a timer, scoring system, or other game-specific features.

6. Shuffling Cards: At the start of the game, the card pairs should be shuffled randomly, so players don't know where each item is located.

7. Timer (Optional): An optional timer can be used to show how long it took the player to beat the game.

8. Scoring System (Optional): A scoring system can be added to keep track of a player's performance. For example, you can give points for each successful match and deduct points for incorrect guesses.

9. Win Condition: The game should have a condition for determining when it's won. Typically, this occurs when all card pairs have been matched.

10. User Interface (UI): The UI includes elements like a start button, a reset button, and, if desired, a score display, timer display, and feedback messages.

11. Game Over Screen: When the game is won, a game over screen can be displayed, showing the player's score, time taken, and an option to restart the game.

12. Responsive Design: The game should be designed to work on various screen sizes, including mobile devices, by using responsive web design techniques.

13. Audio (Optional): You can enhance the game with background music, sound effects for card flips and matches, and other audio elements.

14. High Scores and Leaderboards (Optional):
        To add a competitive element, you can implement high scores and leaderboards to motivate players to achieve better results.

15. Accessibility Features: Ensure the game is accessible to users with disabilities by providing alternative text for images, keyboard navigation, and other accessibility enhancements.

16. Documentation: Document your code and the game's rules so that others can understand and play your game.

17. Testing and Debugging: Thoroughly test your game to identify and fix any issues, ensuring that it works as expected in different web browsers and devices.

18. Deployment: Deploy your game on a web server or a web hosting platform so that it can be played online.
